Introduction/Kupu Arataki
This assessment activity requires you to develop and test a computer programto process phone orders for a take away pizza business, using advanced programming techniques. 

You will be assessed on how effectively you refine your program to ensure that the program:
is a well-structured, logical response to the taskhas been comprehensively tested and debuggedis flexible and robust.You should consider these examples of ways of making a program flexible and robust:using actions, conditions, control structures and methods, functions, or procedures effectivelychecking input data for validitycorrectlyhandling expected, boundary and invalid casesusing constants, variables and derived values in place of literals.When developing your program, you must ensure your program:uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)uses sequence, selection and iteration control structurestakes input from a user, sensor(s), or other external source(s)produces outputfollows common conventions of the chosen programming languageis documented with appropriate variable/module names and comments that describe the code function and behaviour.Your program must usetwo or more advanced programming techniques.Examples of advanced programming techniques include writing code that:  modifies data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries) defines and manipulates multidimensional data in collectionscreates methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters and/or return valuesresponds to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI) requires non-basic string manipulationuses functionality of additional non-core libraries.
